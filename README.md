# ClearVision-AI
ClearVision AI ‚Äì A deep-learning powered cataract detection system that analyzes ophthalmic images using convolutional neural networks. It enables rapid, accurate, and remote screening with heatmap-based visual indicators of lens opacity, supporting early diagnosis and reducing the global burden of cataract-related blindness.

## üöÄ How to Run Cataract Detection Model in Colab

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in Google Colab:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Google Colab
- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
- Create a **new Python notebook**  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Model Files
- Download the pre-trained models from here:  
  üëâ [Download Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ox0D2DQ1nQThEYuGslx_5-XEuiS0Jzlb?usp=sharing)  
- Upload **`cataract_full_model_stage2.keras`** (main model) and optionally **`cataract_stage2_ckpt.keras`** (checkpoint) into Colab by:  
  - Clicking the **folder icon** on the left sidebar  
  - Clicking **Upload** and selecting the files  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get Your Ngrok Auth Token
Ngrok is needed to create a public link for the web app.  

1. Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)  
2. Sign up (free account is enough)  
3. After logging in, go to the **Dashboard ‚Üí Your Authtoken**  
4. Copy the token (it looks like a long random string)  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the Code from GitHub
- Go to this repository and open **`ClearVision-AI.ipynb`**.
- Copy all the code and paste it into your Colab notebook.  

üëâ Don‚Äôt forget to replace this line with your Ngrok token:

```python
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
